This is the 'public' directory.

Any files you place in here (like images, fonts, or your sound files) will be served directly by your application.

For the sounds to work with the code I've provided, please:
1. Create a folder named 'sounds' inside this 'public' directory.
2. Move your .mp3 files into `public/sounds/`.

For example:
- public/sounds/Anger.mp3
- public/sounds/Happy.mp3
- etc.
